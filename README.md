2D-wavelet-for-protein-structural-classes-prediction
We constructed a prediction model based on wavelet denoising using different feature expression methods. A new fusion idea, first fuse and then denoise, is proposed in this article. Two types of pseudo amino acid compositions are utilized to distill feature vectors. Then, a two-dimensional (2-D) wavelet denoising algorithm is used to remove the redundant information from two extracted feature vectors. The two feature vectors based on parallel 2-D wavelet denoising are fused, which is known as PWD-FU-PseAAC.
The project includes three original datasets, source code for two-dimensional wavelet denoising and source code for feature vector prediction.
